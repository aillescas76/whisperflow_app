Review written to `reviews/task_11_review.md` with one high-severity doc/CLI mismatch around `--config` placement plus suggested fixes and verification ideas.

If you want, I can:
1) Update `doc/USAGE.md` to reflect correct `--config` placement.
2) Adjust `whisperflow/cli.py` so `--config` works after subcommands as documented.
