Added a focused review covering bugs/risks, test gaps, and style notes in `reviews/task_3_review.md`.

**Next steps**
1) Address the highest-severity issues (directory input check, missing executable handling).
2) Decide on `language=auto` behavior with the wrapper and adjust accordingly.
3) Add unit tests for `run_transcribe` error handling and command assembly.
