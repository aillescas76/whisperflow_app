Review completed and written to `reviews/task_2_review.md`.

Suggested next steps:
1) Address the override-merging risk in the CLI wiring before Task 3/4 land.
2) Add a top-level CLI error handler for clearer messages (or explicitly defer to Task 10).
3) Add argparse tests in Task 9 for help output and invalid-arg behavior.
